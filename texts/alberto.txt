greetings! my name is alberto.
i hail from a faraway land where magic is almost as commonplace as breathing.
i have been called here by the great colors, to teach you magic.
to begin, let's pour some magenta into a cauldron.
now purchase your first spell (sixth slot) for 10 magic.
great! this spell converts magic into magenta at a 3:1 ratio.
go ahead, try casting it. the first one's on me.
amazing! you're a natural at this!
that is all i can teach you for now.
you can learn the rest by studying the hidden ancient scrolls.
come back to me once you've found the first three.
great! i'll tell you what these spells do.
these spells all exchange magic for colors. 1 magic for 1 second worth.
the time has come for me to go. continue getting stronger my student!
i will see you again soon...
*the man leaves in a puff of smoke*
